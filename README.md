Key Features of Your Project

	1.	Data Structure:
	•	 MusicData struct that manages the data related to music albums and popular releases. It uses a static function to retrieve album and popular music information, including attributes like name, artist, cover image, description, and a link to the music.
	2.	View Models:
	•	The HomeViewModel is an ObservableObject that manages the state for the main home view of the app. It keeps track of:
	•	The header title.
	•	A list of albums and popular music.
	•	The currently selected music.
	•	A flag to show or hide the music player.
	•	The PlayerViewModel (which you referenced but did not detail) likely manages the playback state and controls of the music player.
	3.	Views:
	•	HomeView: This would be the main interface where users can browse through albums and popular tracks. It displays the album covers and music information.
	•	PlayerView: This view acts as the music player interface. It shows details about the selected track, including the album cover, song title, artist name, and playback controls (play/pause, skip, etc.). You have also implemented functionality to open a link to the song when the play button is tapped.
	4.	Music and Album Management:
	•	The app pulls album data from MusicData, displaying them in a user-friendly manner. Users can select an album or a popular track to view more details and access the player.
	5.	User Interaction:
	•	Users can select music to play, which updates the player view with the selected track’s details. The playback controls allow for play, pause, and skipping tracks, enhancing user experience.
	6.	User Experience Enhancements:
	•	The design includes a neuromorphic style for buttons and other UI elements, creating a modern and visually appealing interface.
	•	Additional features like a slider for playback progress and buttons for liking tracks are included to engage users further.

Overall Functionality

My project aims to create a seamless music browsing and playback experience centered around Fuji Kaze’s discography. It allows users to explore albums, listen to music, and easily access links to streaming platforms for the songs.
